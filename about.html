<p>
    I'm <strong>Kit</strong>, a web designer based out of Atlanta, GA. I recently graduated with a BS in
    Computer Science and am currently running a brand-new web operations startup, with the goal of assisting in providing
    information/resources to traditionally under-served communities.
