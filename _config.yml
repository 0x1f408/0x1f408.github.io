# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://0x1f408.me" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com

# This probably isn't needed, but I wanted to add an easy way to grab year for copyright info, etc.
year: 2017

# Do we also want to add something to define when the site was last updated?
# We could probably define the above (`year`) with the same
#last_update:

# Where do we look for assets? (images, js, etc)
assets: "/assets" # Make sure this doesn't have a following "/".
