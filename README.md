Jekyll portfolio for 0x1f408, a.k.a. **Kit**, a Washington, DC-based web developer.

## About the site:
#### What's Here:

Not much, yet. Eventually, this is intended to serve as a listing of projects I'm involved in, but for now it's a
*very* rough work-in-progress, as I get the theme set up in a way I'm happy with (it could be a while).

#### Theme:

The site theme is something I'm tentatively calling `catbox`, and is intended to facilitate portfolio creation. 
It will eventually be released in full on [rubygems](rubygems.org) as a Jekyll theme.

#### To-do:

* clean up rough formatting (especially the sidebar).

* finish stylesheet (`main.scss`)

* create a few color themes

* add a `Designs` (or `Gallery`) section with:

  * descriptions of work done (who/what/where/when)
  
  * actual designs created
